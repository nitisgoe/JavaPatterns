# JavaPatterns: Type Safety Approaches

This project demonstrates various ways to achieve type safety in Java. 
Type safety is a critical aspect of robust software development, ensuring that variables are only assigned values compatible with their declared types, reducing runtime errors and improving code maintainability.

## Project Structure

- **client/**: Contains API client classes for interacting with external services.
- **exceptions/**: Custom exception classes for error handling, including type safety violations.
- **models/request/**: Data models for API requests, demonstrating type-safe request structures.
- **models/response/**: Data models for API responses, ensuring type-safe handling of returned data.
- **utils/**: Utility classes for JSON processing and validation, supporting type-safe operations.
- **test/**: Unit tests to verify type safety and correct behavior of the implemented patterns.

## Type Safety Techniques Covered

- Strong typing with Java generics (Serialization and Deserialization)
- Custom exceptions for type errors
- Data models and can also be used for validation and business values
- API client patterns enforcing type-safe requests and responses
